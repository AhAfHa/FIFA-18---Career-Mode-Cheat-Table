# FIFA 18 - Career Mode Cheat Table

This is a brief walk-through tutorial that illustrates how to use mine Cheat Table for FIFA 18. Before you start using it, I'd recommend you to make a __backup of your current career mode save__ and regular backups of your further progress. Trust me, you don't want to start a new career after 5 seasons because something will screw up.

## F.A.Q

* **Can you make a cheat for FUT/Pro Clubs?**
  - No, I can't. Stop asking about that.


* **Can you add X/Y/Z ?**
  - Depends on what it is. If you have got a request write [here](https://github.com/xAranaktu/FIFA-18---Career-Mode-Cheat-Table/labels/request) and maybe one day you will see it added to the table.


* **It's possible to make X/Y/Z?**
  - It's my favourite question. Guys, basically everything is possible, but not everything is worth doing. Do you want to play as Mario? Sure, it's possible, but I'll not spend 5 years on trying to import Mario model to the game just because one crazy guy wants to replace Messi with Italian plumber. If you have got a request write [here](https://github.com/xAranaktu/FIFA-18---Career-Mode-Cheat-Table/labels/request) and maybe one day you will see it added to the table.


* **Why cracked version is not supported?**
  -  Cracked version is not supported because I've got original game copy bought on Origin. Most probably my game version and your game version will differ because I've got the newest patch, and you not. So, ingame functions are different, addresses are different, after a few patches we will probably play a different game.


* **After activating function nothing happens, what's wrong?**
  - Try to restart the game and cheat engine, or maybe even your PC. If it's not helping try to use older versions of cheat table.


* **My game is crashing.**
  - It's a right time to use your save backup. :)


## Getting Started

After you unzip the archive you probably notice that there are actually two cheat tables. So, which one you should use? If you have a trial game version (Origin Access) then use "FIFA18_TRIAL.exe - Career Table.CT", otherwise use "FIFA18 - Career Table.CT". To open this file you need to install [Cheat Engine](http://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php). I'd recommend to download and install the newest version of it.

## The Journey

* **99 Skill Points**
  -  99 Skill points available to spend in The Journey game mode.


* **Edit Attributes**
  - You can edit all attributes (except skill moves and weak foot) of your star in The Journey. If you go over 99 points in any of the attributes you may be not able to complete training session, so keep that in mind.

## Sim Match Settings

* **Max_cards = 0**
  - Players in both teams will not receive any cards during match simulation.


* **Max_injuries = 0**
  - Players in both teams will not get injured during match simulation.

## Free and Unlimited Releasing Players
* **Free & Unlimited Releasing Players**
  - By default, the game is allowing us to release only 2 or 3 players from your club during season. This script is allowing you to release as many players as you want from your club without paying anything. Remeber that you can't have less than 20 players in your senior team.

## Contract Negotiation
Any terms you set here will be accepted by the player during contract negotiations.

* **Contract Negotiation**
  - Wage - Self-explanatory. It's 500 by default. 
  - Contract Length - Self-explanatory. It's 72 by default (6 years). 
  - Release Clause - Self-explanatory. It's 0 by default, so a player will not have a release clause. 
  - Squad Role - It's 5 by default. 5 = Prospect, 4 = Sporadic, 3 = Rotation, 2 = Important, 1 = Crucial
  - Signing Bonus - It's 0 by default.
  - Bonus Type - It's 0 by default. 0 = Appearances, 1 = Clean Sheets, 2 = Goals scored
  - Bonus Type - Count - It's 50 by default. 
  - Bonus Type - Sum - It's 5 by default. You will pay 5$ after player will reach bonus type count.

## Editing Player

[Editing Player Name](https://youtu.be/OvjyZ4nKL_U?t=37)

* **Unlock "Edit Player" in career menu**
  - This is equivalent to buying "Edit player in career" in EASFC Catalogue. Nothing more.

* **Easy Player Edit**
  - Activate this script and in-game go to "Squad->Edit Player-> Choose the player you want to edit", go back to the table and make your changes. Make sure you "Apply & exit" in-game, otherwise, your changes will not save. 
  - If you want to edit "Known As" make sure that you picked a player with "Known as" to initialize pointers. As you can see on [Video](https://youtu.be/OvjyZ4nKL_U?t=37) I'm picking Isco, because he has a "Known as" name.

* **Player_Data**
  - [Video](https://youtu.be/Y9t2QilaC8M?t=552). This script is also allowing us to edit player, but it's riskier. Here we are overwritting data in database, so there is a risk that we overwrite something 
sensitive and our career mode will be screwed because of this. 
  - If you don't know how to change birthdate check [F.A.Q](#f.a.q). Or use "Easy Player Edit"
  - Base value is 1 (Cheat engine will display 0), so max. value for attributes is 98 (it will be 99 in-game).
  - If you don't know how to change traits check [F.A.Q](#f.a.q)
  - Height - Base value is 130cm. So, if you put 0 in cheat engine that means your player will be a 130cm height. You shouldn't go over 215cm (85 in CE).
  - Weight - Base value is 30kg. So, if you put 0 in cheat engine that means your player weight will be a 30kg. You shouldn't go over 115kg (85 in CE).
  - Max. value for skill moves and weak foot is 4 (it will be 5 in-game)
  - attackingworkrate & defensiveworkrate. 0 = medium, 1 = low, 2 = high
