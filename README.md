# FIFA 18 - Career Mode Cheat Table

This is a brief walk-through tutorial that illustrates how to use mine Cheat Table for FIFA 18. Before you start using it, I'd recommend you to make a __backup of your current career mode save__ and regular backups of your further progress. Trust me, you don't want to start a new career after 5 seasons because something will screw up.

## F.A.Q

* **Can you make a cheat for FUT/Pro Clubs?**
  - No, I can't. Stop asking about that.


* **Can you add X/Y/Z ?**
  - Depends on what it is. If you have got a request write [here](https://github.com/xAranaktu/FIFA-18---Career-Mode-Cheat-Table/labels/request) and maybe one day you will see it added to the table.


* **It's possible to make X/Y/Z?**
  - It's my favorite question. Guys, basically everything is possible, but not everything is worth doing. Do you want to play as Mario? Sure, it's possible, but I'll not spend 5 years on trying to import Mario model to the game just because one crazy guy wants to replace Messi with Italian plumber. If you have got a request write [here](https://github.com/xAranaktu/FIFA-18---Career-Mode-Cheat-Table/labels/request) and maybe one day you will see it added to the table.


* **Why cracked version is not supported?**
  -  Cracked version is not supported because I've got original game copy bought on Origin. Most probably my game version and your game version will differ because I've got the newest patch, and you not. So, ingame functions are different, addresses are different, after a few patches we will probably play a different game.


* **After activating function nothing happens, what's wrong?**
  - Try to restart the game and cheat engine, or maybe even your PC. If it's not helping try to use older versions of cheat table.


* **My game is crashing.**
  - It's a right time to use your save backup. :)


## Getting Started

After you unzip the archive you probably notice that there are actually two cheat tables. So, which one you should use? If you have a trial game version (Origin Access) then use "FIFA18_TRIAL.exe - Career Table.CT", otherwise use "FIFA18 - Career Table.CT". To open this file you need to install [Cheat Engine](http://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php). I'd recommend to download and install the newest version of it.
